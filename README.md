# Bank-Loan-Report--Excel
## Project Overview
The "Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard" project provides a detailed assessment of loan applications, funding, interest rates, and borrower demographics. This interactive dashboard is designed to help financial institutions identify patterns, assess loan quality, and make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and reduce risks.
## Problem Statement
Managing a large volume of loan applications effectively while minimizing the risks associated with bad loans is crucial for any financial institution. This analysis addresses:

1. What are the trends in loan applications over time?
2. What is the distribution of good vs. bad loans?
3. Which factors (such as loan purpose, employee length, or homeownership) impact loan performance?
4. What states have the highest loan applications?
5. How do metrics like DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio and interest rates influence loan outcomes?
